Linked here is a fusion table that demonstrates geocoding and heatmapping unemployment stats from 2011 by county for the entire us. As of publish date (5-1-2013) full 2012 stats are not available.

Open and resave in your Google Account. This is a large file and takes a while to load along with maps and data. Three basic concepts are demonstrated on the Google Maps API: geocoding, heatmapping and focusing on specific locales (PA & OH) to demonstrate data parsing and searching from the larger table (cards).
