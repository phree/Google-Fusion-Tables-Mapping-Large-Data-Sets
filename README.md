This repository is really is a link to a Google Fusion Table that demonstrates: large datasets, geocoding and heatmapping U.S. 2011 unemployment stats by county. As of publish date (5-1-2013) full reporting of 2012 stats is not available.

Open and save in your Google Account. This is a large file and takes a while to load along with maps and data. Three basic concepts are demonstrated on the Google Maps API: geocoding as a data link (fusion table combine key), heatmapping by column stats and using filter patterns to focus on specific locales (e.g., PA & OH) creating subsets with corresponding maps derived from the larger table. As in a NoSQL database, the filters work as views that can be used to generate multiple iterations of data visualization on the same dataset.  Click on a country and data from selected table columns is shared in the pop-out dialog.

Try copying the patterns and sorts shown to create new versions of this map.
